# ``SwiftVISASwift``

Allows for message based communication over the VISA protocol for TCPIP instruments. `SwiftVISASwift` is a native backend and does not require the user to have NI-VISA installed.

## Overview

Historically, the use of VISA requires the installation of NI's C VISA. `SwiftVISASwift` has been written to provide an open-source alternative for NI's C VISA backend. Currently only TCPIP connections are supported. To use NI's C VISA backend with SwiftVISA, see [NISwiftVisa](https://github.com/SwiftVISA/NISwiftVISA)
